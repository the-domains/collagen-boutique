  Gold Native Collagen is a pure collagen formula enriched with substances that
  have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, antifungal and general
  regenerative properties. It also demonstrates powerful anti-aging properties.
  Designed for people with problematic and hypersensitive skin, prone to
  discolourations, lichens and eczemas. Synergy of colloidal gold with collagen
  peptides acts according to the ionic pump principle: it speeds up the
  migration of active substances and exchange of microelements as well as
  stimulates the transdermal cleansing process. It prevents discolourations and
  has soothing, antibacterial and biostimulating properties. Lactoferrin,
  responsible for collagen gel’s its light pink tint, is a bioactive protein
  with anti-inflammatory and anti-acne properties.Always cleanse the skin with
  water prior to collagen application. Biologically active collagen peptides are
  better absorbed if the gel is delicately patted on moist skin, not rubbed in.
  The best and even most spectacular effects of na¬tive collagen are seen when
  applied immediately after peeling. It is strongly recommended that the
  collagen be applied to the face, neck and cleavage twice daily, in the morning
  and in the evening. Irritated or burned skin requires the application of as
  much collagen as can be absorbed. The first effects of the product are clearly
  felt as soon as several minutes after the application of the gel.
