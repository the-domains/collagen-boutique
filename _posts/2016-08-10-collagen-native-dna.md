# Collagen Native DNA - keep your DNA safe!

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/51cb2c7b62538e178ebd38a2d12b196b38102b49.png" /><h1>Collagen Native DNA</h1><p>Collagen native DNA combines nature and the latest biochemical engineering. DNA repair and its protection is the most element to make the skin look healthy. It is Native Collagen Pure enriched with active ingredients that support and activate natural processes creating connective tissue. It intensely stimulates cells to function properly. This mechanism, however, is disturbed, degraded and subjected to oxidative stress.  </p></article>

The depreciation of the skin begins due to two reasons: 

_- bad moisturizing and oiling from the outside, which causes loss of skin cement _

_- microcracks in the lipid coat, through which epidermal water escapes,_

_- effects of free oxygen radicals. _

They cause cell damage, damage to the DNA and RNA. The cells die faster and provide erroneous information to other cells. The use of the best active ingredients is not enough to make the natural mechanisms of the skin act properly at the cellular level. The repair and protection of the DNA is the most important element in maintaining healthy skin appearance. The body has the ability to repair its nucleic acids, but these mechanisms are also disturbed, degraded and constantly subjected to oxidative stress. Without producing and maintaining adequate quantities of healthy cells it is not possible to build sufficient amounts of collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, fibronectin or other "bricks" of our skin. Collagen DNA aims not only to ensure the proper processes, but to intensify their activity and stimulate the appropriate cells to perform planned activities. 

Collagen Native DNA:

• protects cells and DNA against reactive forms of oxygen, photo-aging, UVA rays 

• increases the synthesis of collagen and other basic nutrients of the skin 

• activates the cells to rebuild 

• widens peripheral vessels, improves blood circulation 

• improves lipid metabolism and regulates cholesterol 

• improves the synthesis of ATP
