  Colloidal nanosilver (Axonnite) is an extremely effective, natural
  antibacterial agent. It destroys over 650 different bacteria, whereas an
  antibiotic usually acts on no more than 10. Axonnite nanoparticles are about
  10 times smaller than viruses and about 100 times smaller than the smallest
  bacteria. The substance helps cure burns, wounds that are difficult to heal,
  every type of acne, insect bites, herpes and atopic dermatitis.
